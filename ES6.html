Mutate Array with an const

const s = [5, 7, 2];

s can't be used now to point to different array.

But elements in the array can be mutated.

ex)
  s[0] = 2;
  s[1] = 5;
  s[2] = 7;



Rest/Spread 

Rest 'parameter' creates an array by taking various elements as function parameters. 

It allows us to use map, filter and reduce methods. 

ex) 
  function howMany(...args) {
    return "You have passed " + args.length + " arguments.";
  }
  console.log(howMany(0, 1, 2));

Spread 'operator' unpacks or packs the values in an array 

ex)
  const arr = [2, 4, 19, 8];
  Math.max(...arr);

ex) 
  [a, ...b] = [1, 2, 3, 4]; // a = 1, b = [2, 3, 4]

!But you can't use spread operator to pack values in the middle. 



Object Destructuring in nested object

const LOCAL_FORECAST = {
  yesterday: { low: 61, high: 75 },
  today: { low: 64, high: 77 },
  tomorrow: { low: 68, high: 80 }
};

const {today: { low, high }} = LOCAL_FORECAST; //low = 64, high = 77

This would take low and high as variables. If you want to give them differet names:

const {today: { low: todayLow, high: todayHigh }} = LOCAL_FORECAST; //todayLow = 64, todayHigh = 77
