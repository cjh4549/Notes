Mutate Array with an const

const s = [5, 7, 2];

s can't be used now to point to different array.

But elements in the array can be mutated.

ex)
  s[0] = 2;
  s[1] = 5;
  s[2] = 7;


Rest/Spread 

Rest 'parameter' creates an array by taking various elements as function parameters. 

It allows us to use map, filter and reduce methods. 

ex) 
  function howMany(...args) {
    return "You have passed " + args.length + " arguments.";
  }
  console.log(howMany(0, 1, 2));

Spread 'operator' unpacks values in an array 

ex)
  const arr = [2, 4, 19, 8];
  Math.max(...arr);
