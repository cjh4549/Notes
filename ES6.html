Mutate Array with an const

const s = [5, 7, 2];

s can't be used now to point to different array.

But elements in the array can be mutated.

ex)
  s[0] = 2;
  s[1] = 5;
  s[2] = 7;



Rest/Spread 

Rest 'parameter' creates an array by taking various elements as function parameters. 

It allows us to use map, filter and reduce methods. 

ex) 
  function howMany(...args) {
    return "You have passed " + args.length + " arguments.";
  }
  console.log(howMany(0, 1, 2));

Spread 'operator' unpacks or packs the values in an array 

ex)
  const arr = [2, 4, 19, 8];
  Math.max(...arr);

ex) 
  [a, ...b] = [1, 2, 3, 4]; // a = 1, b = [2, 3, 4]

!But you can't use spread operator to pack values in the middle. 



Object Destructuring in nested object

const LOCAL_FORECAST = {
  yesterday: { low: 61, high: 75 },
  today: { low: 64, high: 77 },
  tomorrow: { low: 68, high: 80 }
};

const {today: { low, high }} = LOCAL_FORECAST; //low = 64, high = 77

This would take low and high as variables. If you want to give them differet names:

const {today: { low: todayLow, high: todayHigh }} = LOCAL_FORECAST; //todayLow = 64, todayHigh = 77



Promise
It's a javscript way of making a promise to do something asynchronously. It's a constructor function, so you need a 'new' keyword to create it. 

const myPromise = new Promise( (resolve, reject) => {
  //It takes two parameters: resolve and reject 
})

Resolve and reject are methods that take arguments. 

const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  
  let responseFromServer;  

  if(responseFromServer) {
    resolve("Promise was fulfilled"); // Usually it would be an object from an API call 
  } else {
    reject("Promise was rejected");
  }
});

If the response from the server is received, then you can use .then() to retrieve the response.

makeServerRequest.then(result => {
  console.log(result);
});

The result would be the argument that was passed into the resolve method earlier. 
For reject state: 

myPromise.catch(error => {
  console.log(error);
});

Promise is useful for operations that take time such as server requests(API calls). 


API calls

Using fetch: 

fetch('someURL')
  .then((response) => return response.json())
  .then(object => console.log(object));

Async: 

async function apiCall() {
  let response = await fetch('someURL');
  let data = await response.json();
  return data;
}
apiCall().then(object => console.log(object));

!But it's bad at error handling. How do you resolve this? 

fetch(url)
  .then((response) => {
    if (response.status >= 200 && response.status <= 299) {
      return response.json();
    } else {
      throw Error(response.statusText);
    }
  })
  .then((object) => {
    // do whatever you want with the JSON response
  }).catch((error) => {
    // Handle the error
    console.log(error);
  });
      
Axios: 

It's most commonly used for better browser support, error handling and in React and other frameworks. 
      
You have to npm install the axios as it's an open source libray or use an external CDN. 
      
<script src="https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
<script>
  axios
    .get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users")
    .then(response => {
      console.log(response.data);
    })
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
</script>
