//Pure React

const App = () => {
  return React.createElement(
    "div",
    {},
    React.createElement("h1", {}, "Adopt Me!")
  );
};

//What's the difference betwe App rendered as a function above and App as an instance below?  
//Above: creating a line of car (blueprint)
//Below: factory stamping out that car 

ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(App), document.getElementById("root"));

//Props

const Pet = (props) => {
    return(
        React.createElement('div', {}, [
            React.createElement('h1', {}, props.name),
            React.createElement('h2', {}, props.animal),
            React.createElement('h2', {}, props.breed),
        ])
    )
}

const App = () => {
    return React.createElement("div",{}, [
        React.createElement("h1", {}, "Adopt Me!"),
        React.createElement(Pet, {
            name: 'Luna',
            animal: 'Dog',
            breed: 'Havanese'
        }),

      
//App is the parent that's rendering Pet 
//App is drilling down props into Pet 
//The direction is downwards always 
//This is much easier to maintain, because you don't have to worry about parent anymore after we started dealing with children components 
      
//npm init -y
//npx means install the package and run it right away


What does all the files do in React?

      1. package.json: This is where you install dependencies from npm 
        - Dependencies: libraries from npm that you need for final production version for your project to work 

It's usually good idea to export one component per file

Once you are done with the development, you have to run 'npm run build' that will create codes for deployment

Virtual DOM
- The problem: every time DOM manipulation happens with JS, the broswer re-renders the entire site each time
- Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM, like a blueprint
- So when you made changes on the site, changing on VDOM is like changing blueprint, instead of changing the actual room structure 

In general, keep your components small 

Conditional Rendering
- You CAN use if statement at the root of the component to render different components 
- But imagine there is already a wrapper UI component, and inside of it you want to conditionally render a 'value'
- Because JSX is returned inside the parentheses, it's an expression and thereby you can't put statements in there
- You can use ternary operator to achieve this: 

      {count % 2 === 0 ?
      <h1>Count is even</h1> :
      <h1>Count is odd</h1>}
      
 - The ternary operator is great if you have two UIs to show, but there may be a case where you want to show just one UI or nothing at all based on a condition
       
      {count % 2 === 0 && <h1>Count is even</h1>}
      
 - But this can be dangerous as an empty string or zero can evaluate to falsy value, which can cause an unpredictable behaviours 
 
      {count % 2 === 0 ? <h1>Count is even</h1> : null}

Loop
- Array.map is the go to
- Make sure to have key to each item you iterate through to create 
  ex) <li key={id}>{name}</li>
- Do not use index instead of ID because React won't properly optimize the performance 

Event
- It's an user action such as mouse click, hover, key press and etc.
- In vanilla JS, you would create a selector on an element and add a listener to it, and listen for the behaviour

  const button = document.querySelector('button');
    button.addEventListenr('click', function(){
      console.log('clicked');
    })

- In React, it's written in a more 'declarative' way
- Instead of selecting an element from DOM through querySelector, you can reference an event 'directly' on the element

  function Events() {
    return(
      <button onClick={() => console.log('clicked')}>Click</button>
    )
  }

- But more commonly, instead of using an anonymous function, you declare a handleEvent function and call it in the element

  function Events() {
    const handleClick = () => {
      console.log('clicked');
    }
  
    return(
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>
    )
  }

- You can pass handleClick as a prop to a child component: 

    function Events() {
      const handleClick = () => {
        console.log('clicked');
      }

      return(
        <ChildComponent onClick={handleClick}/>
      )
    }

    function ChildComponent({ onClick }) {
      return <button onClick={onClick}>Click</button>
    }


State
- A data that changes throughout the lifecycle of the app
- Props can be passed between components but they are immutable, so what if you want to change the value? 
- import { useState } from 'react';
- A hook can only be used at the top level of the component 
- const [count, setCount] = useState(0);


UseEffect
- Mount, Update, Unmount <- React lifecycle of the component: 
  Component is mounted on a component tree, state changes and rerenders the component, component unmounts/removed from the tree
- componentDidMount(){
    //Fetch Data here
  }
- componentWillUnmount(){
    //Terminate the stream of the data
  }

React Router DOM
- <Link to=""></Link> provides navigation to different pages in the app using to="string" pathway.
- But it's not actually rendering different 'views'
- It's just changing the URLs 
- And based on this different URLs, now you have to render different views of the page using <Routes>, <Route> components 

- <BrowserRouter> is from react router dom and provides the best looking URLs but the server needs to be configured correctly
- To use the router, it has to be at the top level of the root element so you wrap it around the <App> component
ex) <BrowserRouter><App/></BrowserRouter>


Fetching API in React
- fetch('api link')
    .then(//JSON the object)
    .then(//The actual formatted data result that you can put it into React state)
    .catch((err) => {
    
      //this error doesn't capture the error if there is a typo at the end of endpoint:
      
      https://randomuser.me/api/?resultsssssssss=8 <-- this will still return the data 
      ttps://rander.me/api/?results=8 <-- this will console log the error message 
      
      So you have to create a manual error using throw new Error method
    })
